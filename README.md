# Dmemset

This is part of my [Google Summer of Code project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6103365956665344/#5475582328963072), _Independency of D from the C Standard Library_.

It is a public repository for the work on the `memset()` replacement.

## Compile and Run
`dmd bench.d Dmemset.d -O -inline && ./bench average` (DMD - Optimized and Inlined)
